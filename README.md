# deps-new [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new)

A new, simpler alternative to `clj-new`.

Intended to be installed as a "tool" (Clojure CLI 1.10.3.933 or later).

```bash
clojure -Ttools install io.github.seancorfield/deps-new '{:git/tag "v0.4.0"}' :as new
```

> `clj-new` inherently carries along all of the baggage of `lein new` and `boot new`, including a modified chunk of Leiningen itself, as well as depending on Pomegranate for loading dependencies (so as to be compatible with Leiningen and Boot), and Stencil for the variable substitution in templates. The recently-released `tools.build` library, from the core Clojure team, provides all of the functionality needed to create new projects from templates, so `deps-new` aims to provide a wrapper around `tools.build`, some standard templates "out of the box", and machinery to allow you to easily write your own templates, mostly with no code needed at all.

The `app` and `lib` templates in `deps-new` are currently almost identical to those in `clj-new`, in terms of what
they provide in generated projects, although they need no code: `deps-new` templates are primarily declarative,
using a `template.edn` file to describe how parts of the template are copied into the target project folder.

You can get help on the available functions like this:

```bash
clojure -A:deps -Tnew help/doc
```

## Create an Application

```bash
clojure -Tnew app :name myusername/mynewapp
```

Creates a directory `mynewapp` containing a new application project, with `myusername` as the
"top" namespace and `mynewapp` as the main project namespace:

```clojure
;; mynewapp/src/myusername/mynewapp.clj
(ns myusername.mynewapp
  (:gen-class))

(defn greet
  "Callable entry point to the application."
  [data]
  (println (str "Hello, " (or (:name data) "World") "!")))

(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (greet {:name (first args)}))
```

## Create a Library

```bash
clojure -Tnew lib :name myusername/mycoollib
```

Creates a directory `mycoollib` containing a new library project, with `myusername` as the "top" namespace
and `mycoollib` as the main project namespace under that.

If you want to generate the project into a different directory than the project name, use
the `:target-dir` option to specify a path to the directory that should be created:

```bash
clojure -Tnew lib :name myusername/mycoollib :target-dir projects/newlib
```

Creates a directory `projects/newlib` containing a new library project, with `myusername` as
the "top" namespace and `mycoollib` as the main project namespace under that.

## Create a Template

```bash
clojure -Tnew template :name myusername/mytemplate
```

Creates a directory `mytemplate` containing a new template project, with `myusername` as the "top" namespace
and `mytemplate` as the main project namespace under that. The generated template
project will work as a template that produces a library project, but you can
change it to produce whatever you want.

If you want to generate the project into a different directory than the project name, use
the `:target-dir` option to specify a path to the directory that should be created:

```bash
clojure -Tnew template :name myusername/mytemplate :target-dir projects/newtemplate
```

Creates a directory `projects/newtemplate` containing a new library project, with `myusername` as
the "top" namespace and `mytemplate` as the main project namespace under that.

## Create a Minimal "scratch" Project

If you just want a very minimal `deps.edn` project to experiment with:

```bash
clojure -Tnew scratch :name play
```

Creates a directory `play` containing an empty `deps.edn` file and `src/scratch.clj`
with a simple `exec` function (you can invoke via `clojure -X scratch/exec`) and a
simple `-main` function (you can invoke via `clojure -M -m scratch`). This is intended
to be a minimal "playground" to get started with `deps.edn` and the CLI.

## Create a Fully-Fleshed `pom.xml`

```bash
clojure -Tnew pom :name com.acme/cool-lib :target-dir .
```

Creates a `pom.xml` file in the current directory (_overwriting any existing file!_)
that has all the fields needed to publish a project to Clojars and have cljdoc.org
generate the documentation, e.g.,

```xml
  <groupId>com.acme</groupId>
  <artifactId>cool-lib</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>com.acme/cool-lib</name>
  <description>FIXME: my new org.corfield.new/pom project.</description>
  <url>https://github.com/com.acme/cool-lib</url>
...
  <scm>
    <url>https://github.com/acme/cool-lib</url>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/acme/cool-lib.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/acme/cool-lib.git</developerConnection>
    <tag>v0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</tag>
  </scm>
```

You should run `clojure -Spom` to synchronize the `<dependencies>` from your `deps.edn` file.

## More General Usage

Currently those are the only four built-in templates (`app`, `lib`, `pom`, and `scratch`).

More general usage:

```bash
clojure -A:somealias -Tnew create :template com.acme.project/cool-lib :name myusername/mynewproject
```

Looks for `com/acme/project/cool_lib/template.edn` on the classpath (based on the `:somealias` alias) and,
if present, uses that template to create a project, in `mynewproject`. Instead of `-A:somealias`, you
could use `-Sdeps` to specify the dependencies needed to make the template available:

```bash
clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {com.acme.project/cool-lib}}' -Tnew create :template com.acme.project/cool-lib :name myusername/mynewproject
```

In case the template is defined in a local directory, you need to specify the path to it like this:

```bash
clojure -Sdeps '{:paths ["resources"]}' -Tnew create :template '"/cool-lib"' :name myusername/mycoollib 
```
This would search for the template.edn in local folder `resources/cool-lib`

See [**Project Names and Variables**](doc/names-variables.md) to see how the project name (`:name`)
is used to derive the default values of all the built-in substitution variables.
See [**All the Options**](doc/options.md) for the full list of command-line options available
when invoking `deps-new`. See [**Writing Templates**](doc/templates.md) for documentation on
how to write your own templates.

## The Generated `LICENSE` File

The generated projects (from the built-in `app`, `lib`, and `template` templates) all
contain a `LICENSE` file which is the Eclipse Public License (version 1.0) and that
is also mentioned in the generated `README.md` files. This is a tradition that started
with Leiningen's `lein new` and carried over into `boot new` and now `clj-new`. The
idea is that it's better to ensure any open source projects created have a valid
license of some sort, as a starting point, and historically most Clojure projects use
the EPLv1.0 because Clojure itself and the Contrib libraries have all used this license
for a long time.

**You are not required to open source your generated project!** Just because the projects
are generated with an open source `LICENSE` file and have a **License** section in their
`README.md` files does not mean you need to keep that license in place, if you do not
want your project to be open source.

**You are not required to use EPLv1.0 for your project!** If you prefer a different license,
use it! Replace the `LICENSE` file and update the `README.md` file to reflect your personal
preference in licensing (I have tended to use the
[Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) in most of my open
source projects, prior to working with Clojure, but see
[Prefer the MIT License](https://juxt.pro/blog/prefer-mit) for an alternative
viewpoint from the folks who wrote XTDB).

> Note: if you incorporate any source code from other people's open source projects, be
aware of the legal implications and that you must respect whatever license _they_ have
used for that code (which _may_ require you to release your enhancements under the same
license and will, most likely, require you to include their copyright notices, etc).
_Do not copy other people's code without attribution!_
